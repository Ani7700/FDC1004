#FDC1004 

This Library provides basic functionality for the FDC1004 Capacitance to Digital Sensor. The FDC1004 provides femto-farad precision for measuring capacitances up to 100pF.

## Requirements

 * Arduino
 * FDC1004

## Limitations
 * This library currently does not support differential capacitive measurements
